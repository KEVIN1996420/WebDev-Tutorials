            <p>Where better to begin than where it all started. Data anlaysis was never my first choice, i took a chance, asked my employer whether there are any new projects that require attention. My employer mentioned a few, only one seemed challenging, that fascinated me. I immediately took the project on.</p>
            <p>Lead Data Analyst was the title i recieved after completion of the NSFAS project.
                Working with the Department of Education, South African Government, Shield Technology and multiple corporate companies.
                After the project the job offers came rolling in, i was amazed by the outcome of the project, and word quickly reached companies looking for Data Analysts.
            </p>
            <p>This was when i came to realize the fascination i have for data, all i wanted to do was Data Analysis. It was months before our company recieved another data anlysis project.
                So what did i do, what anyone else would do, chose a new project, and what i chose was Web Development. 3 days into the project, no idea what im doing and where to start.
            </p>
            <p>
                Long story short. Next moment my employer changes my job title to web Developer. And that is where my road to a full stack web developer started.
            </p>
            <p>
                Never did i imagine i would be working in the wide field of Information Technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've never been more excited, my next goal is to be the Lead Senior Web Developer and next onto the Lead Software Engineer.
